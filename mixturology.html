		<H3> DISPUTATION OF THE OFFICE OF THE POPE OF MIXTUREOLOGY

		ON THE POWER AND EFFICACY OF OREO CONSUMPTION </H3>

		<p> 
			Out of love for the truth and the desire to bring to eternal destruction the heathenish cult of Oreology, the following propositions will be discussed in a future publication under the presidency of Ye Moste Righteous Pope of Mixtureology, Master of Arts and of Sacred Mixtures, and Lecturer in Ordinary on the same at the Current Vatican. Wherefore he requests that those who are unable to be present and debate orally with us, may make such a desire known by a general announcement to section 008 of Biblical Worldviews.
			<br><br>
			Because reasons. Amen.

<ol>
	<li> Our Moste Righteous Pope, when he said something that none of us wrote down or can quite remember, willed that the whole life of believers should be the consumption of mixed drinks.</li>

	<li> This statement, whatever it was, cannot be understood to mean sandwich cookies, i.e., Oreos and Newman-O&#8217;s, which are evil unless the Pope really wants some.</li>

	<li> Yet it means not all mixed beverages; nay, there is no righteous mix which comprises three or more substances.</li>

	<li> The penalty of consuming a Fell Mixture, therefore, continues until a Hail Mixture is imbibed; for this is the true inward repentance, and continues until whenever the Pope feels like it.</li>

	<li> The Pope does intend to remit, and can remit any penalties which he has imposed either by his own authority or by that of Ye Moste Righteous Imbible.</li>

	<li> The Pope can remit any guilt by declaring that it has been remitted by His Popeliness and by sentencing the offender to a Hail Mixture; though, to be sure, he may not grant remission in cases reserved to his judgment. If his remission is not provided, the guilt remains entirely unforgiven.</li>

	<li> The Pope remits guilt to no one whom He does not, at the same time, humble in all things and bring into subjection to Ye Moste Righteous Imbible. Unless he really wants to.</li>

	<li> The penitential canons are imposed only on whoever the Pope wants, and, according to them, nothing should be imposed on the Pope.</li>

	<li> Therefore the Pope is kind to us-sometimes-because in his decrees he does whatever suits his mood.</li>

	<li> Ignorant and wicked are the doings of those priests who insist that the Southern Baptists drink Mixes containing orange juice instead of sweet tea. Utter nonsense.</li>

	<li> The changing of the canon of Mixtureology to the heresy of Oreology is quite evidently one of the tares that were sown while the bishops slept.</li>

	<li> In former times the Oreologists were rightly condemned, as Ye Moste Righteous Imbible hath commanded.</li>

	<li> The converted are not freed from the Pope&#8217;s wrath; they acquiesce to canonical rules, and must abide by them.</li>

	<li> The imperfect health [of stomach], that is to say, the imperfect diet, of the Oreologist brings with it, of necessity, great indigestion; and the worse the diet, the greater is the indigestion.</li>

	<li> This indigestion is sufficient of itself alone (to say nothing of other things) to constitute the penalty of repentance, since it is very near to the horror of despair.</li>

	<li> Hell (Oreology), purgatory (disbelief), and heaven (Mixtureology) seem to differ as do despair, almost-despair, and the assurance of safety.</li>

	<li> With souls trapped in Oreology it seems necessary that indigestion ought to grow less and antacid increase.</li>

	<li> It seems unproved, either by Pope or Ye Moste Righteous Imbible, that they are outside the state of merit, that is to say, of increasing mixture consumption.</li>

	<li> Again, it seems unproved that they, or at least that all of them, are certain or assured of their own damnation, though we may be quite certain of it.</li>

	<li> Therefore by "full remission of all penalties" the pope means not only "of the uninitiated," but "of all."</li>

	<li> Therefore those preachers of assured damnation are in error, who say that by the Pope's decree a man is not freed from Oreology, and saved;</li>

	<li> Whereas he remits to souls in Oreology no penalty aside from that which, according to the canons, they must pay: a Hail Mixture.</li>

	<li> If it is at all possible to grant to any one the remission of all penalties whatsoever, it is certain that this remission can be granted only to the most perfect, that is, to the Pope.</li>

	<li> It must needs be, therefore, that the greater part of the people are deceived by that indiscriminate and high-sounding promise of release from penalty.</li>

	<li> The power which the Pope has, in a general way, over purgatory, is far exceeding the power which any bishop or curate has, in a special way, within his own diocese or parish.</li>

	<li> The Pope does well when he grants remission to souls [in Oreology], not by the power of the keys (which he does possess but chooses not to use), but by way of intercession.</li>

	<li> They preach man who say that so soon as the penny jingles into the money-box, the soul flies out [of Oreology].</li>

	<li> It is certain that when the penny jingles into the money-box, gain and avarice can be increased, but the result of the intercession of the Hail Mixture is in the power of the Pope alone.</li>

	<li> Who knows whether all the souls in Oreology wish to be bought out of it, as in the legend of Dr. Van Engen.</li>

	<li> No one except the Pope is sure that his own contrition is sincere; much less that he has attained full remission.</li>

	<li> Rare as is the man that is truly penitent, so rare is also the man who truly delights the Pope, i.e., such men are most rare.</li>

	<li> They will be condemned eternally, together with their teachers, who believe themselves sure of their salvation because they have Canadian Oreos, which are supposed to be “the best.”</li>

	<li> Men must be on their guard against those who say that the Pope's pardons are not that inestimable gift by which man is reconciled to him;</li>

	<li> For these "graces of pardon" concern all, including the penalties of sacramental satisfaction.</li>

	<li> They preach no Mixtureologist doctrine who teach that contrition is necessary in those who intend to buy souls out of Oreology.</li>

	<li> Every truly repentant or unrepentant Mixtureologist has a right to full remission of penalty and guilt, as long as the Pope declares it to be so.</li>

	<li> Every true Mixtureologist, as long as he lives, has part in all the blessings of the Pope and the Mixtures; and this is granted him by the Pope with or without letters of pardon.</li>

	<li> The forgiveness and participation [in the blessings of the Mixtures] which are granted by the Pope are in no way to be despised, for they are, as I have said, the declaration of remission.</li>

	<li> It is most difficult, even for the very keenest theologians, at one and the same time to commend to the people the abundance of pardons and [the need of] true contrition.</li>

	<li> True contrition seeks and loves penalties, but the Pope&#8217;s pardons relax penalties.</li>

	<li> Apostolic pardons are to be preached with caution, lest the people may falsely think them preferable to works of the Pope.</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be taught that the Pope does intend the buying of pardons to be compared to works of mercy.</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be taught that he who gives to the poor or lends to the needy does a pretty darn good but different work than buying pardons;</li>

	<li> Because love grows by works of love, and man becomes better; but by pardons man does not grow better, only more free from penalty.</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be taught that he who sees a man in need, and passes him by, and gives [his money] for pardons, purchases the indulgences of the Pope and the indignation of that man.</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be taught that even when they have more than they need, they are bound to keep back what is necessary for their own selves and families, and by no means to squander it on Oreologists.</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be taught that the buying of pardons is a matter of free will, which they absolutely shall obey at all costs.</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be taught that the Pope, in granting pardons, needs, and therefore desires their devout prayer for him almost as much as the money they bring.</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be taught that the Hail Mixtures are useful; but altogether harmful, if through them they lose their health of stomach.</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be taught that the Pope would prefer that the heathenish cult of Oreology should be built up with the skin, flesh, bones, and sandwich cookies of its sheep.</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be taught that it would be the pope's wish, as it is his duty, to give of his own money to very many of those certain hawkers of pardons who cajole money, even though the church of St. Peter might have to be sold.</li>

	<li> The assurance of salvation by Oreology is vain, even though the commissary, nay, even though Dr. Van Engen himself, were to stake his soul upon it.</li>

	<li> They are enemies of Mixtureology and of the Pope, who bid Ye Moste Righteous Imbible be altogether silent in some gatherings, in order that Oreology may be preached in others.</li>

	<li> Injury is done Ye Moste Righteous Imbible when, in the same sermon, an equal or a longer time is spent on this text than on the heathenish ways of Oreology.</li>

	<li> It must be the intention of the Pope that if pardons, which are a very small thing, are celebrated with one bell, with single processions and ceremonies, then the demise of Oreology, the heathenish cult, should be preached with a hundred bells, a hundred processions, a hundred ceremonies. Because ceremonies are cool.</li>

	<li> The Hail Mixtures, out of which the pope grants indulgences, are not sufficiently named or known among the people of Mixtureology, except by the Prophet, the most distinguished of the beverage experimentalists.</li>

	<li> That he is not a temporal Mixer is certainly evident, for many of his concoctions transcend time and space to be recorded in the very foundations of the earth.</li>

	<li> Nor is such power solely derived from the Pope, for even without Ye Moste Popely Blessings, he always works grace for the inner man and damnation for the taste buds.</li>

	<li> St. Franklin said that the treasures of Mixtureology were Ye Moste Righteous Mixtures, as he recorded upon Ye Moste Aluminum Tablets.</li>

	<li> Without rashness we say that the Hail Mixtures of the Prophet, given by the Pope's merit, are that treasure;</li>

	<li> For it is clear that for the remission of penalties and of all cases, the power of the Pope is of itself sufficient.</li>

	<li> The true treasure of Mixtureology is the Moste Righteous Damnation of the heathenous cult of Mixtureology.</li>

	<li> This treasure is naturally most acceptable, for it makes for much amusement.</li>

	<li> On the other hand, the treasure of Oreology is naturally most odious, for it is a terribly heathenish cult.</li>

	<li> Therefore the treasures of Mixtureology are swords with which they are wont to slash at the foundations of Oreology.</li>

	<li> The treasures of the Mixtures are nets with which they now fish for the stomachs of men.</li>

	<li> The tenets of Oreology which Dr. Van Engen cries as the "greatest graces" are known to be truly such, in so far as they promote gain-gain of weight.</li>

	<li> Yet they are in truth the very smallest graces compared with the grace of the Pope.</li>

	<li> Bishops and curates are bound to admit the commissaries of Ye Moste Popely pardons, with all reverence.</li>

	<li> But still more are they bound to strain all their eyes and attend with all their ears, lest Dr. Van Engen preach the dreams of the heathenish cult of Oreology.</li>

	<li> He who speaks against the truth of Popely pardons, let him be anathema and accursed!</li>

	<li> But he who guards against the lust and license of the Oreology-preachers, let him be blessed!</li>

	<li> The Pope justly thunders against those who, by any art, contrive the injury of the traffic in Oreology.</li>

	<li> But much more does he intend to thunder against those who use the pretext of Biblical Worldviews to further the heathenish cult of Oreology.</li>

	<li> To think the Popely pardons so great that they could absolve a man even if he had committed an impossible sin and consumed an Oreo - this is pretty darn accurate.</li>

	<li> We say that the Oreologist pardons are not able to remove the very least of venial sins, so far as guilt is concerned.</li>

	<li> It is said that Dr. Van Engen, if he were now Pope, could bestow greater graces; this is blasphemy against Mixtureology and against the Pope.</li>

	<li> We say, on the contrary, that the present Pope has greater graces at his disposal than those heathenish followers of the heathenish cult of Oreology.</li>

	<li> To say that the Oreo, emblazoned with that wicked company&#8217;s coat of arms, which is set up [by the preachers of Oreology], is of equal worth with the Hail Mixture is blasphemy.</li>

	<li> The bishops, curates and theologians who allow such talk to be spread among the people, will have an account to render.</li>

	<li> This unbridled preaching of Oreology makes it no easy matter, even for learned men, to rescue the reverence due to Mixtureology from slander, or even from the shrewd questionings of the laity.</li>

	<li> Why should the Pope not destroy such heathenous cults, for the sake of holy love and of the dire need of the souls that are there, if he redeems from them an infinite number of souls for the sake of miserable money with which to build a Moste Holy Drink Machine?</li>

	<li> Why are recurring monetary contributions by the dead not continued, and why should he return or permit the withdrawal of the endowments founded on their behalf, since it has already been given to the Pope?</li>

	<li> What is this new piety of Oreology, that they forsake all Hail Mixtures and Moste Righteous commands of the Pope for the imperfect contentment provided by these foul sandwich cookies?</li>

	<li> Why should the penitential canons, long since in actual fact and through perennial use alive and relevant, not be satisfied by the Hail Mixtures?</li>

	<li> Why does not the Pope, whose wealth is to-day greater than the riches of the richest, build this one church and Moste Holy Drink Machine with the money of poor believers, rather than with his own money?</li>

	<li> What is it that the Pope cannot remit, and what participation does he not grant to those who, by his blessings, have a right to full remission and participation?</li>

	<li> What greater blessing could come to the Church than if the Pope were to do whatsoever he feels like, and maybe bestow on some believers these remissions and participations?</li>

	<li> Since the Pope, by his pardons, seeks the salvation of souls rather than money, why should he not rain absolute terror and destruction upon the heathenish cult of Oreology?</li>

	<li> To repress arguments and scruples of the laity by fabricating reasons (such as unbridled destruction being decidedly awesome) is to expose Oreology to the ridicule of its enemies, and to make the Pope content.</li>

	<li> If, therefore, Mixtureology were preached according to the spirit and mind of the Pope, doubts would be readily resolved; nay, they would not exist.</li>

	<li> Away, then, with all those prophets who say to the people of the Pope, "This is nonsense," for there is much sense!</li>

	<li> Blessed be all those prophets who say to the people of the Pope, "That&#8217;s... interesting, I guess," for that it is!</li>

	<li> Mixtureologists are to be exhorted that they be diligent in following the Pope through the many tribulations of life;</li>

	<li> And thus be confident of entering into health of stomach rather through the assurance of peace, than through many tribulations.</li>
